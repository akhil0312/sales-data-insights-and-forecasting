# Sales Data Insights & Forecasting

**Project Type**: Data Analytics & Time Series Analysis  
**Tools / Languages**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib / Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 1. Overview  
This project analyzes historical sales data to uncover business insights, trends, and patterns across products and regions. It also explores basic forecasting models to predict future sales. The goal is to provide actionable intelligence to support decision-making.

---

## 2. Motivation / Problem Statement  
- Many businesses struggle to align inventory, marketing, and operations with future demand.  
- With sales data available, we can analyze performance across time, region, product, etc., and build forecasting models to anticipate what’s coming.  
- This helps in better planning, reducing stockouts or overstock, and prioritizing high-impact SKUs and regions.

---

## 3. Dataset & Data Understanding  
- **Source / Description**: (Write a one-line about where the data came from – is it publicly available, internal, or synthetic?)  
- **Key Fields**: Sales, Order Date, Product, City / Region, etc.  
- **Time Span / Granularity**: (E.g., daily, monthly, years covered)  
- **Missing Values / Anomalies**: (Brief note on what you found about nulls, duplicates, outliers)

## 4. Approach & Methodology  

| Phase | Steps |
|-------|-------|
| Data Cleaning & Preprocessing | Drop unused columns, handle missing values, convert dtypes, parse dates |
| Feature Engineering | Create `month`, `year`, aggregated metrics |
| Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) | Trends over time, city-wise, product-wise, seasonality, correlations |
| Forecasting / Prediction (Baseline) | Fit a simple time series / regression model to predict next period sales |
| Interpretation & Business Insights | Translate findings into business recommendations |

> ⚠️ *Note: The forecasting here is baseline. You can expand it further in future versions (e.g. ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM).*

---

## 5. Key Findings & Insights  
- Most products are concentrated in top 3 SKUs (generate ~X % of revenue)  
- City **X** shows seasonal dips in months **Y–Z**, possibly due to local demand patterns  
- Sales growth is strongest in quarters **Q2 / Q4**  
- Product **A** has consistent monthly growth, while Product **B** is more volatile  

*(You should fill in numbers / facts from your analysis.)*

---

## 6. Forecasting Results  
- Baseline model (e.g., linear regression or simple time series) achieved **RMSE = …**, **MAE = …**  
- Predictions for next 3–6 months: [include plot or table]  
- Compare predicted vs actual (if test data available)  

---

## 7. Recommendations / Business Implication  
- Focus inventory / marketing on top SKUs in months of peak demand  
- Consider promotional campaigns in months with dips to smooth revenue  
- Expand inventory in emerging cities showing upward trend  
- Reassess underperforming product lines (or test changes)

---

## 8. Limitations & Next Steps  
- Dataset may not include external factors (seasonal holidays, promotions, macroeconomic variables)  
- Forecasting is basic — accuracy may be improved through advanced models (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM)  
- Could build an interactive dashboard (Streamlit / Dash) to let users filter by region / product  
- Feature importance, model explainability, cross-validation improvements
