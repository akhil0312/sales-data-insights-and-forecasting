This project, Sales Data Insights and Forecasting, aims to analyze historical sales data to uncover meaningful business patterns and support data-driven decision-making. The dataset, compiled from multiple CSV files, includes information such as order details, products sold, purchase addresses, and transaction dates.

The notebook performs data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy. Key operations include merging datasets, handling missing or invalid entries, converting data types, and generating new features such as total sales per order, monthly sales trends, and city-wise revenue.

Through detailed visualizations, the project identifies:

The highest revenue-generating months, revealing seasonal or holiday-related sales spikes.

Top-performing cities, highlighting areas contributing most to total revenue.

Best-selling products, providing insights into customer preferences and popular inventory items.

These insights not only showcase the overall sales performance but also help businesses plan marketing strategies, optimize stock levels, and forecast future sales. Future improvements may include integrating predictive models (like ARIMA or Prophet) for demand forecasting and building interactive dashboards for real-time analytics.
